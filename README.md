# Sales-and-Profit
Sales &amp; Profit Analysis Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Excel; utilized pivot tables, advanced functions (VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH) and KPI dashboards to uncover regional sales trends and profitability insights.
## Project Objectives
        To perform a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on sales and profit data across different U.S. states.
        To identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as top-performing products, regions, and categories.
        To uncover patterns and trends in seasonal sales and profitability using temporal features.
        To generate interactive visual dashboards that communicate actionable business insights.
## Dataset Used
  - <a href="https://github.com/hariharanr8/Sales-and-Profit/blob/main/project2(Sales%20and%20Profit%20Data)data.xlsx">Dataset</a>
  - <a href="https://github.com/hariharanr8/Sales-and-Profit/blob/main/project2(Sales%20and%20Profit%20Data).xlsx">Dashboard</a>
## Data columns
    The dataset comprises a structured set of transactional records, encompassing essential dimensions for 
    comprehensive business intelligence and sales performance evaluation. The Order Date field captures 
    the timestamp of each purchase transaction, serving as the temporal anchor from which both the Month and
    Year columns are programmatically derived through datetime parsing techniques—enabling robust 
    time-series analysis. Customer and geographical segmentation are facilitated through the Customer Name and 
    State fields, respectively. Product-related attributes include Category, Sub-Category, and the specific 
    Product Name, supporting hierarchical product analytics. Quantitative performance metrics such as Sales 
    (monetary revenue), Quantity (units sold), and Profit (net earnings) provide the basis for key performance 
    indicator (KPI) tracking and margin analysis. Collectively, these features empower multi-dimensional analysis 
    across temporal, regional, and categorical axes, driving strategic insights into profitability, customer behavior, 
    and market trends.
## Process
     Since the document you uploaded was too large to process, I can't analyze it directly. However, 
     I can guide you through a structured step-by-step approach to working with sales and profit data in Excel. 
     Here’s how you can break it down:
### Step 1: Understanding the Data
     - Open your Excel file and review the structure: look at column headers and identify what data is 
     available (e.g., sales figures, profit margins, dates, categories).
     - Check for missing or inconsistent data that might need cleaning.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preparation
    - Use the Filter feature to identify empty or incorrect entries.
    - Apply Text to Columns (if necessary) to split combined data into separate columns.
    - Use Find & Replace or Trim to remove unnecessary spaces or errors.
    - Apply Data Validation to restrict invalid entries.

### Step 3: Sorting & Filtering
    - Use Sort to arrange the data by sales volume, profit percentage, or time period.
    - Use Filter to view specific categories or ranges within the dataset.

### Step 4: Applying Basic Formulas
    - Calculate total sales: =SUM(range)
    - Compute profit percentage: =(Profit/Sales)*100
    - Find highest/lowest sales values: =MAX(range) and =MIN(range)

### Step 5: Pivot Tables for Summarization
    - Insert a Pivot Table (Insert > PivotTable) to analyze trends by region, time period, or product category.
    - Drag relevant fields into Rows and Values sections to summarize sales and profits.

### Step 6: Creating Dashboard for Visualization
    - Use Bar or Line Charts to show sales trends over time.
    - Apply Pie Charts to compare profit distribution across different categories.
    - Use conditional formatting to highlight key insights.
