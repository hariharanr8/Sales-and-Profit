# Sales-and-Profit
Sales &amp; Profit Analysis Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Excel; utilized pivot tables, advanced functions (VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH) and KPI dashboards to uncover regional sales trends and profitability insights.
## Project Objectives
        To perform a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on sales and profit data across different U.S. states.
        To identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as top-performing products, regions, and categories.
        To uncover patterns and trends in seasonal sales and profitability using temporal features.
        To generate interactive visual dashboards that communicate actionable business insights.

## Data columns
    The dataset comprises a structured set of transactional records, encompassing essential dimensions for 
    comprehensive business intelligence and sales performance evaluation. The Order Date field captures 
    the timestamp of each purchase transaction, serving as the temporal anchor from which both the <b>Month and
    Year</b> columns are programmatically derived through <b>datetime</b> parsing techniquesâ€”enabling robust 
    time-series analysis. Customer and geographical segmentation are facilitated through the Customer Name and 
    State fields, respectively. Product-related attributes include Category, Sub-Category, and the specific 
    Product Name, supporting hierarchical product analytics. Quantitative performance metrics such as Sales 
    (monetary revenue), Quantity (units sold), and Profit (net earnings) provide the basis for key performance 
    indicator (KPI) tracking and margin analysis. Collectively, these features empower multi-dimensional analysis 
    across temporal, regional, and categorical axes, driving strategic insights into profitability, customer behavior, 
    and market trends.
